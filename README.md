This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and prediction model for housing prices using Linear Regression. The dataset includes various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities, which are used to predict the price of a house.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats using label encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Provides insights into the data distribution, relationships between features, and identification of outliers.
- **Modeling**: Implements a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on the selected features.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results

The Linear Regression model shows a strong correlation between the features and the target variable, with an R-squared value indicating a good fit. The model can be further improved by experimenting with different features or using more advanced algorithms.
